## notes

### What Is gRPC?

> gRPC is an open-source Remote Procedure Call framework that is used for high-performance communication between services.

> gRPC uses protocol buffers. Protocol buffers can describe the structure of data and the code can be generated from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data.
